# Database Backup Directory

This directory contains database backups for the RetroNetPortal application.

## Purpose

- Store regular backups of the database
- Provide a recovery mechanism in case of data loss
- Enable version control of database schema and data

## Usage

Database backups are automatically generated by the `db_backup.py` script. Manual backups can also be created as needed.

## File Format

Backups are stored in JSON format to maintain compatibility across different database systems and to make the data human-readable when necessary.

## Retention Policy

- Daily backups are kept for 7 days
- Weekly backups are kept for 4 weeks
- Monthly backups are kept for 6 months

## Restoration

To restore from a backup, use the restoration functionality in the admin dashboard or run the recovery script directly.
